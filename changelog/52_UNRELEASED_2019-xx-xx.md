- Chores improvements
  - New option "Due date rollover" per chore which means the chore can never be overdue, the due date will shift forward each day when due
- General improvements/fixes
  - Improved the handling which entry page to use with disabled feature flags (thanks @nielstholenaar)
  - Fixed that the Userfield type "Preset list" had always the caption "Product group" instead of the configured one (thanks @oncleben31)
- API improvements
  - New endpoint `/stock/shoppinglist/remove-product` to remove a product from a shopping list (thanks @Forceu)
  - When adding a product (through `stock/product/{productId}/add` or `stock/product/{productId}/inventory`) with omitted best before date and if the given product has "Default best before days" set, the best before date is calculated based on that (so far always today was used which is still the case when no date is supplied and also the product has no "Default best before days set) (thanks @Forceu)
