### Calendar improvements
- Improved that meal plan events in the iCal calendar export now contain a link to the appropriate meal plan week in the body of the event (thanks @kriddles)

### General & other fixes
- Fixed that the meal plan menu entry (sidebar) was not visible when the calendar was disabled (`FEATURE_FLAG_CALENDAR`) (thanks @lwis)
