- Fixed that deleting meal plan entries did not work
- Fixed a problem that the user settings were not properly initialized for the frontend JS part when not logged only (so potentially affected only the login page)
- Fixed an issue that the shopping list did not load when a plural translation for a quantity unit was missing
- Fixed that tooltips were visible forever when consuming all products on the stock overview page
- Fixed that login did not work when "Stay logged in permanently" was set on grocy runs on a 32-bit system
- Improved that errors/messages from the API are shown properly when undoing a stock booking is not possible (stock journal page)
- Improved night mode CSS (done by @BlizzWave, thanks!)
