- Fixed the messed up message/toast after consuming a product from the stock overview page
- Fixed that "Track date only" chores were always tracked today, regardless of the given date
- Fixed that the "week costs" were wrong after removing a meal plan entry
- Fixed wrong recipes costs calculation with nested recipes when the base recipe servings are > 1 (also affected the meal plan when adding such a recipe there)
