- Fixed the messed up message/toast after consuming a product from the stock overview page
- Fixed that "Track date only" chores were always tracked today, regardless of the given date
- Fixed that the "week costs" were wrong after removing a meal plan entry
- Fixed wrong recipes costs calculation with nested recipes when the base recipe servings are > 1 (also affected the meal plan when adding such a recipe there)
- Improved recipes API - added new endpoints to get stock fulfillment information (thanks @Aerex)
- Improved date display for products that never expires (instead of "2999-12-31" now just "Never" will be shown)
- Improved date display for dates of today and no time (instead of the hours since midnight now just "Today" will be shown)
- Improved shopping list handling, items can now be switched between lists (there is a shopping list dropdown on the item edit page)
