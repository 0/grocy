ERP beyond your fridge

## Motivation
A household needs to be managed. I did this so far (almost 10 years) with my first self written software (a C# windows forms application) and with a bunch of Excel sheets. The software is a pain to use and Excel is Excel. So I searched for and tried different things for a (very) long time, nothing 100 % fitted, so this is my aim for a "complete houshold management"-thing.

## What it is about
For now my main focus is on stock management, ERP your fridge!

# Give it a try

## How to install
Just unpack the [latest release](https://github.com/berrnd/grocy/releases/latest) on your PHP enabled webserver, copy `config-dist.php` to `config.php`, edit it to your needs, ensure that the `data` directory is writable and you're ready to go. Alternatively clone this repository and install Composer and Bower dependencies manually.
